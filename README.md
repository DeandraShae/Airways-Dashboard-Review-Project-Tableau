### ✈️ Project Overview
For this project, I created a **data visualization dashboard** focused on customer reviews of British Airways. The aim was to explore various **customer experience metrics** and provide insights into key aspects such as **service quality**, **seat comfort**, **food & beverages**, and **overall satisfaction**. I analyzed these reviews across different **aircraft models** and **traveler experiences** to deliver actionable insights for British Airways or similar aviation stakeholders.

Shout-out to **Mo Chen** for this project! 🙌
